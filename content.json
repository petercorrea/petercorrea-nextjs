    "description": "I build software. My work requires discussing the scope and goal of each solution, sharing tradeoffs between different implementations, establishing milestones, and deploying high-quality code. A typical day involves optimizing algorithmic and network performance, deploying servers, migrating databases, integrating APIs, building machine learning models, interviewing candidates, collaborating with designers, presenting to management, and researching standardized specifications. When I'm not working on products, I'm leading teams, managing talent, and driving operations. Common tools include JavaScript, Python, Typescript, React, Node, AWS, GraphQL, Postgres, SQL, MongoDB, Docker, Git, HTML, CSS, and more. My experience includes web and native projects; government and commercial clients. In my personal life, I'm always curious about mathematics, algorithms, machine learning, and electrical engineering. Current projects include building an image classifier with neural networks and a recommendation engine for matching similar users. When I'm not in front of the computer, I'm likely in front of a smaller computer I refer to as my phone. Pursuing a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering. If your project involves improving economic opportunity, public health, access to education, climate, food and resources, or alternative currencies"
